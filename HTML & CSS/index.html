    <h3>Classification</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Chytridiomycota</b> 
            <br><small>division of the Fungi kingdom. The name refers to the chytridium (from the Greek chytridion, meaning "little pot"): the structure containing unreleased spores. In older classifications, chytrids (except the recently established order Spizellomycetales) were placed in the Class Phycomycetes under the Subdivision Myxomycophyta of the Kingdom Fungi. However, chytrids are actually protistans. Also, in an older and more restricted sense (not used here), the term "chytrids" referred just to those fungi in the order Chytridiales.</small>
        </li>
        <li><b> Glomeromycota</b>
            <br><small> one of six currently recognized phyla within the kingdom Fungi, with approximately 200 described species. All species are thought to form arbuscular mycorrhizas with the roots or thalli (e.g., in the case of bryophytes) of land plants. However, this has not yet been shown for all species. The majority of evidence shows that the Glomeromycota are obligate biotrophs, dependent on symbiosis with land plants for carbon and energy, but there is recent circumstantial evidence that some species may be able to lead an independent existence.</small>
        </li>
        <li><b>Zygomycota</b> 
            <br><small>are a phylum of fungi. The name of the phylum comes from zygosporangia, where resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction. Approximately 600 species of zygomycetes are known. They are mostly terrestrial in habitat, living in soil or on decaying plant or animal material. Zygomycete hyphae may be coenocytic, forming septa only where gametes are formed or to wall off dead hyphae.</small>
